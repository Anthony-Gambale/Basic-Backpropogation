The file extension .pyde is for the program 'Processing,' a text editor for code that also supplies libraries
for drawing shapes and using colours and images.
To open and run this file, you need both Processing and the python extension (as processing is typically for Java).
After downloading processing, python mode can be installed from within the program.
